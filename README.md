# Rotman-Lens-60GHz
This is a project where I design, fabricate, and test a Rotman Lens @ 60 GHz on RO4003C substrate. The design uses MATLAB to create the geometry, and HFSS to simulate the conditions. The fabrication uses Georgia Tech's Hive Makerspace and testing takes place at the mmWave Antennas and Arrays Lab.
